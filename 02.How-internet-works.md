# 🌐 Internet Fundamentals (Notes)

## 1. How the Internet Works

* Internet mainly works via **fiber optic cables** laid under the sea.
* These cables connect **data centers** around the world.
* Companies like **AT\&T, Reliance Jio** own/manage these cables.
* We pay for usage → called *data packs / internet recharge*.

### Data Centers

* Huge locations filled with **many computers/servers**.
* Purpose: **store and transmit data**.
* Data flows from data centers → through fiber cables → to ISPs → to your device.

---

## 2. Internet Service Providers (ISPs)

* Local providers: e.g., **Jio, Airtel, YouBroadband**.
* ISPs connect your device to the global internet.
* Your request (e.g., youtube.com) → goes to ISP → forwarded further.

---

## 3. Servers

**Definition:** A computer dedicated to serving information.

Types:

* **Email Server** → delivers emails.
* **File Server** → stores & serves files.
* **Database Server** → stores structured data, allows queries.
* **Application Server** → runs business logic (e.g., YouTube, Facebook backend).
* **Web Server** → serves static files like HTML, CSS, images.

🔑 Key Difference:

* **Web Server** → serves static data.
* **Application Server** → serves dynamic data (logic, computation).

Examples:

* Web Server: **Nginx, Apache**
* Application Server: **Node.js, Django**

## 4. Client vs Server

* **Server** → Serves information.
* **Client** → Requests information.

Examples of clients:

* Browser (Chrome, Firefox)
* Phone, Laptop

Flow Example:

1. You type `youtube.com` in browser.
2. Browser asks **ISP** if you have internet access.
3. ISP forwards request.
4. Domain (youtube.com) → resolved by **DNS (Domain Name Server)** to an **IP address**.
5. Request sent to correct application server.
6. Server responds → Data flows back via cables → to your device.

---

## 5. DNS (Domain Name System)

* Maps **domain names** → **IP addresses**.
* Example:

  * Domain: `youtube.com`
  * DNS maps it to: `142.250.xx.xx`

---

## 6. Types of Applications

### a) Standalone Applications

* Do **not require internet or external servers**.
* Example:

  * Feedback kiosk at airports.
  * Coin-operated standalone systems.
* Runs independently without DB, Email server, etc.

### b) Web Applications

* Run **on the internet**.
* Examples: **Instagram, YouTube, Facebook**.
* Supported by multiple servers:

  * Database servers
  * Application servers
  * Email servers
  * Web servers

---

## 7. Application Support & Maintenance

* Applications run on **Operating Systems** (Windows, Linux, MacOS).
* Support/maintenance ensures:

  * Apps run correctly.
  * No frequent crashes.
  * All connections (DB, Email, Cache, etc.) are working.
* Example: If email server connection breaks → no emails sent.

👉 A **DevOps Engineer** must:

* Know which type of application is running (standalone or web).
* Ensure connectivity between all dependent services.
* Handle issues like server downtime, DB connection failure, etc.

## 8. Quick Interview Pointers

* **Internet works via fiber optic cables (not satellites for video streaming).**
* **Server vs Client:** Server serves data, client requests data.
* **Web Server vs Application Server:** Static vs Dynamic content.
* **DNS role:** Domain → IP mapping.
* **Types of Applications:** Standalone vs Web.
* **Why Application Maintenance?** To ensure app stability and connectivity.

✨ This is just the **foundation**. Later topics (like Linux, Bootloaders, LVM, Cloud, etc.) build on this.
