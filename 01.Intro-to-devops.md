# üìå DevOps Zero to Hero ‚Äì Day 1 (Detailed Notes)

## 1. **What is DevOps?**

* DevOps is **not just a tool or a technology** ‚Äì it is a **culture, mindset, and way of working**.
* The main goal is to **deliver applications faster** while ensuring:

  * **Automation** ‚Üí fewer manual interventions.
  * **Quality** ‚Üí higher reliability of applications.
  * **Monitoring** ‚Üí continuous feedback about system health.
  * **Testing** ‚Üí integrated into pipelines instead of being a separate step at the end.
* Many people confuse DevOps with **just CI/CD pipelines** (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.), but that‚Äôs only one part.
* DevOps = **collaboration between Development & Operations** ‚Üí breaking silos.

---

## 2. **Why DevOps?**

* **Traditional Software Delivery (10‚Äì15 years ago):**

  * Multiple specialized roles:

    * **System Admins** ‚Üí managed servers, deployments.
    * **Build & Release Engineers** ‚Üí packaged & released software.
    * **Testers** ‚Üí tested software quality separately.
    * **Developers** ‚Üí wrote code, then ‚Äúthrew it over the wall.‚Äù
  * Problems:

    * Too many silos, each team worked in isolation.
    * Heavy reliance on **manual processes**.
    * Very **slow delivery cycles** (sometimes releases only once or twice a year).

* **With DevOps:**

  * Silos are broken down.
  * Automation replaces manual processes.
  * Continuous monitoring ensures issues are caught earlier.
  * Releases become **faster, more reliable, and more frequent**.
  * End goal ‚Üí **Speed + Quality + Feedback Loop**.

## 3. **How to Introduce Yourself in a DevOps Interview**

The instructor explains that **your introduction should depend on your background**.

### ‚úÖ If you are **Experienced**:

* Mention your **years of experience in DevOps**.
* Talk about your **previous roles** (System Admin, Build & Release Engineer, Developer, Automation Engineer, etc.).
* Show a **transition story** ‚Üí how you moved into DevOps naturally from your earlier role.
* Example:

  > ‚ÄúI started my career as a Linux System Administrator where I managed servers and deployments. Later, I worked in Build & Release, setting up automation for software delivery. Over the years, I transitioned into DevOps, focusing on CI/CD, infrastructure automation, and monitoring. Currently, I work on building end-to-end delivery pipelines that ensure applications are deployed quickly and reliably.‚Äù

### ‚úÖ If you are a **Fresher**:

* You can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI have 5 years of experience in DevOps.‚Äù Instead:

  * Highlight your **learning journey**.
  * Mention **hands-on practice** with projects.
  * Express **passion for automation and problem-solving**.
* Example:

  > ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Vighnesh, a BSc IT graduate. I‚Äôve been learning and practicing DevOps concepts with hands-on projects. My focus is on automating deployments, setting up CI/CD pipelines, and integrating monitoring and testing to ensure smooth delivery of applications. While I don‚Äôt have industry experience yet, I‚Äôve applied these concepts in personal projects and I‚Äôm confident about contributing effectively to a DevOps team.‚Äù

## 4. **Day-to-Day Activities of a DevOps Engineer**

(Will be explained in later sessions, but mentioned here as an upcoming focus.)

* Managing and improving CI/CD pipelines.
* Infrastructure automation (Terraform, Ansible, etc.).
* Monitoring applications and systems (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack).
* Handling version control workflows (Git, branching, merging strategies).
* Working closely with developers and testers to ensure smooth releases.

---

## 5. **Common Interview Questions Covered**

* **Q1: What is DevOps?**

  * DevOps is a culture that ensures faster, reliable application delivery through automation, monitoring, testing, and collaboration between development and operations.

* **Q2: Why DevOps?**

  * To solve the inefficiencies of traditional IT delivery (manual work, silos, slow releases) and enable faster, higher-quality deployments with automation and monitoring.

* **Q3: Introduce yourself as a DevOps Engineer.**

  * Tailor your intro based on whether you are a fresher or experienced.
  * Always connect your **past background ‚Üí current role/learning ‚Üí DevOps practices**.

‚úÖ This Day 1 session mainly focused on **mindset + interview prep basics**. Technical deep dives (CI/CD, tools, pipelines, monitoring, etc.) will come in later sessions.
