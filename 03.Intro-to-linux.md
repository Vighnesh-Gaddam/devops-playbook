# 🐧 Linux Basics – Day 1 (Detailed Notes)

---

## 🔹 What is Linux?

* Linux is an **Operating System (OS)** – a software layer that allows hardware (CPU, memory, storage, etc.) and applications to work together.
* Developed by **Linus Torvalds** in 1991.
* Distributed under the **GNU General Public License (GPL)** → Free and open-source.
* Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux is widely used in **servers, cloud computing, DevOps, networking, and cybersecurity**.
* Linux powers **most of the internet infrastructure**.

💡 Example: Google, Facebook, Amazon servers mostly run on Linux.

## 🔹 Why Linux?

* **Cost** → Free to use, unlike Windows (paid license).
* **Security** → Virus-resistant, better permission management.
* **Performance** → Faster, lightweight, can run on old machines.
* **Stability** → Rarely crashes, used in critical environments (banking, aviation, telecom).
* **Customization** → Source code is open, can be modified.

## 🔹 Windows vs Linux

| Feature   | Windows                      | Linux                         |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| License   | Paid                         | Free & Open Source            |
| Security  | Prone to viruses             | Highly secure                 |
| Updates   | Frequent, heavy              | Lightweight & controlled      |
| Usage     | Desktop OS, gaming           | Servers, DevOps, Cloud, IoT   |
| Community | Closed-source, MS controlled | Open-source, global community |

## 🔹 Ways to Run Linux

1. **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**

   * Install Linux directly inside Windows 10/11.
   * Run Linux commands without leaving Windows.

2. **VirtualBox / VMware**

   * Create a virtual machine (VM) on top of Windows/Mac.
   * Run Linux inside the VM as a guest OS.

3. **Cloud Platforms**

   * Providers: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.
   * Create a Linux server remotely and access it via **SSH**.

4. **Vagrant**

   * A HashiCorp tool to easily create/manage VMs.
   * Popular for DevOps practice and automation.

## 🔹 Linux Architecture

Linux has 4 major components:

1. **Kernel**

   * Core of the OS.
   * Written in **C language**.
   * Responsibilities:

     * Process management
     * Memory management
     * Device management
     * File system management

2. **Shell**

   * Interface between **user** and **kernel**.
   * Takes user input (commands), sends it to Kernel, returns output.
   * Two types:

     * **Command Line Shell** (e.g., Bash, Zsh)
     * **Graphical Shell** (GNOME, KDE)

   Example:

   * Command: `mkdir myFolder`
   * Shell passes it to Kernel → creates folder.

3. **Applications**

   * User programs like browsers, editors, media players, etc.

4. **Hardware**

   * CPU, RAM, Storage, Network cards, Peripherals.

---

## 🔹 Boot Process & Boot Loader

* When you power on the system:

  1. BIOS/UEFI initializes hardware.
  2. **Boot Loader** loads OS into memory.
* Linux uses **GRUB (Grand Unified Boot Loader)**.
* GRUB lets you choose which OS to boot (dual-boot systems).

---

## 🔹 Linux File System Structure

* Everything in Linux is a **file** (including devices, processes, etc.).
* Root (`/`) is the starting point of all directories.

| Directory  | Purpose                                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `/home`    | Stores user files (each user gets a folder).   |
| `/bin`     | Basic system commands/programs (ls, cat, pwd). |
| `/etc`     | Configuration files.                           |
| `/var/log` | System and application log files.              |
| `/tmp`     | Temporary files.                               |
| `/usr`     | User programs and applications.                |
| `/dev`     | Device files (hard drives, USBs).              |
| `/proc`    | Information about running processes.           |

💡 Example:

* Configuring network settings → go to `/etc/network/`.
* Checking system logs → check `/var/log/syslog`.

## 🔹 Essential Linux Commands

* **Navigation & Files**

  * `pwd` → Show present working directory.
  * `cd folder` → Change directory.
  * `ls` → List files.
  * `mkdir folder` → Create folder.
  * `rm file` → Delete file.
  * `rm -r folder` → Delete folder with contents.

* **Disk & Memory**

  * `df -h` → Disk usage (human-readable).
  * `du -sh folder` → Size of a folder.
  * `free -h` → RAM usage.

* **Processes**

  * `ps` → Show running processes.
  * `top` → Interactive process viewer.
  * `kill PID` → Kill a process by ID.

---

## 🔹 Linux Processes

* Each running program = a **process**.
* Each process has a **PID (Process ID)**.

**Process States:**

* **Running** → Currently executing.
* **Sleeping** → Waiting for resources/input.
* **Stopped** → Manually stopped.
* **Zombie** → Process finished but entry remains in process table.

💡 Example:

* Open Firefox → gets a PID.
* If Firefox crashes → still might show as Zombie process.

---

## 🔹 Why Linux is Important in DevOps?

* Most **servers, containers, and cloud systems** run on Linux.
* DevOps tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform) work best on Linux.
* As a DevOps engineer → need to understand:

  * File system
  * Processes
  * Networking (IP, ports, firewalls)
  * Shell scripting

---

## 📌 Interview-Focused Summary

* **Linux is open-source, secure, stable OS created by Linus Torvalds.**
* **Main components** → Kernel, Shell, Applications, Hardware.
* **Boot loader** → GRUB (loads OS).
* **File system starts from `/`** (root).
* **Servers & cloud infrastructure run on Linux → must-know for DevOps.**
* **Processes identified by PID, can be Running, Sleeping, Stopped, Zombie.**
* **Linux vs Windows** → Linux is free, stable, secure; Windows is paid, less secure.
